## User Stories: ðŸ‘¥
### As a busy person, I want to:
- [x] Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them.
- [x] Check things off my list so that I can see what Iâ€™ve done.
- [x] Delete things from the list if I donâ€™t need to do them anymore.
### As a motor-impaired user, I want to:
- [x] Use all the features of the app without a mouse.

## Features: ðŸŒŸ
* Add, delete functionality implemented.
* Deleted items move to deleted section.
* Invalid inputs flagged to the user.


## Learning: ðŸŒ±
* We can test the functionality of our app.
* We can check that passing a given input into our tests returns the expected output.
* We can write tests to mimic the behaviour of a user performing different actions.
* We can write testable, modular functions.
* We can write functions that add, remove or modify DOM nodes.
* We can apply event listeners to HTML form elements.
* We can use scope to control what variables are accessible inside functions and blocks.


## Improvements and future ideas: âœ¨
- Edit notes. 
- Use local storage to save user information.
